## Market Basket Association Prediction [Apriori Algorithm using R and WEKA]

Machine-learning project using association rule mining to find associative patterns from market-basket data.  The Apriori algorithm was chosen.  By learning buying patterns, companies can improve catalogue content, effectively complete store layout, and find fraud in various transactions (credit-card, network-intrusion). This project used a grocery data set.

**Outcome (Image Below):** The result indicates that “other vegetable” items purchased by a customer will lead to (more than other purchased items) the purchase of the item “whole milk”.  

**Business Impact:**  We can collocate higher priced veggies (a stand of Organics) near milk section, or implement incentive purchase offer programs by the grocer.

**Apriori Algorithm:** Uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules. It is based on the concept that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be a frequent itemset. 

**Association Rule Mining:** A Data Mining technique that finds patterns in data. The patterns found by Association Rule Mining represent relationships between items. When this is used with sales data, it is referred to as **Market Basket Analysis**.

## Recommender System: Film Predictions
###  Content-Based & Collaborative-Based Filtering using Python and surpriselib

Recommender Systems are used to predict items that a user will select among many choices. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders.  Two Types of Recommenders are generally used in production: Collaborative Filtering Systems leverage the behavior and interests of other people (in this case, other movie veiwers) to inform what you might enjoy.  Content-Based Filtering Systems are based on a description of an items and the preferences of users.  

**Movie Predictions:** I used a movide data set
