## Market Basket Association Prediction
###  Apriori Algorithm using R and WEKA
Machine-learning project using association rule mining to find associative patterns from market-basket data.  The Apriori algorithm was chosen.  By learning buying patterns, companies can improve catalogue content, effectively complete store layout, and find fraud in various transactions (credit-card, network-intrusion).  
**Image Below:** The result indicates that “other vegetable” items purchased by a customer will lead to (more than other purchased items) the purchase of the item “whole milk”.  This can be used to collocate items in a store or to implement incentive purchase offer programs by a grocer.

**Apriori Algorithm:** Uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules. It is based on the concept that a subset of a frequent itemset must also be a frequent itemset. Frequent Itemset is an itemset whose support value is greater than a threshold value(support).

**Association Rule Mining:** A Data Mining technique that finds patterns in data. The patterns found by Association Rule Mining represent relationships between items. When this is used with sales data, it is referred to as **Market Basket Analysis**.
