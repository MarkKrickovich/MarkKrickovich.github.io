## Market Basket Association Prediction
###  Apriori Algorithm using R and WEKA
I completed a machine-learning project that used association rule mining to find associative patterns from market-basket data.  The Apriori algorithm was chosen; this algorithm is commonly used to find purchasing patterns between items.  By learning buying patterns, companies can improve catalogue content, effectively complete store layout, and find fraud in various transactions (credit-card, network-intrusion).  The result indicates that “other vegetable” items purchased by a customer will lead to (more than other purchased items) the purchase of the item “whole milk”.  This can be used to collocate items in a store or to implement incentive purchase offer programs by a grocer.
